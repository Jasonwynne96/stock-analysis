# stock-analysis

##Overview of Stocks

The purpose was to provide data on stocks yearly returns and discern which stocks would be better to purchase.

##Results
Year 2017 showed that the majority of the stocks yielded a wide range positive returns. Almost all of them yielded negative returns in 2018. The only two stocks that showed a positive returns in both years were "ENPH" and "RUN". "ENPH" grew more significantly overall.

##Summary

Refactoring definitely can increase performance of the code but could change results if not done correctly.
